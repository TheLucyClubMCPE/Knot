# Knot
A pocketmine plugin to tie servers together. (Like RubberBand, but for the NEW API.)
## Usage
1. Drop the file into your /plugins directory
2. Execute `/stop` in the console
3. Restrat your server with `./start.sh`
4. Configure the proxy, with a lobby, and some other servers you may want to add
5. Type `/server <IP> <PORT>` to join IP with the port PORT or `/join <SERVERNAME:LOBBY>` to teleport to SERVERNAME or LOBBY.

## Configuration
To add a server type `/rs <SERVERNAME> <IP> <PORT> <ROLLBACK IP> [ROLLBACK PORT]`
To add a lobby `/al <IP>`
To start the proxy, type `/proxy --enable`
To connect the proxy type `/proxy --connect <database> <user> <password> <host>` OR `/proxy --add <DIRECTORY>`
_NOTE: When setting a lobby server, use its dynamic internal ip (unless it's external of course) and NOT to 127.0.0.1 because this will send the client to itself, which will crash their game._
__KEY:__

* SERVERNAME - The server servers.yml name
* IP - The IP the client data packet will be sent to
* PORT - The port the client will  be directed to
* ROLLBACK IP - The IP to connect to if the desired server is offline (Default is lobby)
* ROLLBACK PORT - Port to rollback to (Only set if lobby port is not 19132)

### Example Configuration
```
/rs survival 192.168.0.77 16778 127.0.0.1 19132
[INFO] Succesfuly registered server "survival"
/al 192.168.0.96
[INFO] Lobby set to host ip "192.168.0.96"
/proxy --enable
External proxy enabled
/proxy --add C:\users\MrMop43403\Desktop\proxyconnector\proxy.bat
Proxy directory set to "proxyconnector"
```

## FAQ
#### The client can't join
This is because one of the following reasons:

1. You used and external IP for an internal server
 
2. The server port is blocked in the firewall

3. Your servers.yml file is messed up

4. The plugin is not setup on the other server

#### The client gets kicked
This is most likely because you did not set a rollback server.
Re-register the server this time, with a rollback IP and PORT.

#### It says "API Version Not Compatible"
That just means your not on the latest version of PocketMine. You need [PocketMine-MP 1.5](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/releases)
