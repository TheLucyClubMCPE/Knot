# Knot
A pocketmine plugin to tie servers together. (Like RubberBand, but for the NEW API.)
## Usage
1. Drop the file into your /plugins directory
2. Execute `/stop` in the console
3. Restrat your server with `./start.sh`
4. Configure the proxy, with a lobby, and some other servers you may want to add
5. Type `/server <IP> <PORT>` to join IP with the port PORT or `/join <SERVERNAME:LOBBY>` to teleport to SERVERNAME or LOBBY.





_Note: We recomend using [TapTodDo](https://github.com/Falkirks/TapToDo) so you can write a sign or something._
